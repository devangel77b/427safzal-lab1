\begin{abstract}
This experiment aims to investigate the influence of air resistance on falling objects with different masses by comparing the motion at which a penny and a feather fall in environments with and without air. Creating a vacuum seal in the tube and using a high-speed video recorder, the position of each object was observed over time for five trials in each environment. In our air-filled environment, the feather fell significantly slower than the penny, almost floating downwards, resulting in a non-linear graph and a lower $R^2$ value for both objects, demonstrating non-uniform acceleration and changing velocity. On the other hand, in vacuum conditions, both objects exhibited similar position-time behavior within experimental uncertainty, producing similar position-time trends for both objects.. These results are consistent with air resistance significantly affecting the motion of low-mass, high-area objects such as feathers. Conclusions are limited to the specific objects and experimental setup used in this study. However, in an environment without air resistance, all objects experience a constant acceleration, resulting in increasing velocity over time. It is important to note that both objects’ average velocities were calculated and determined as constant within each \qty{0.25}{\second} interval, not overall.

\section{Introduction}
This experiment investigates how air resistance affects the vertical motion of a feather and a penny in a controlled tube under two conditions: with air present and with air partially removed. The motion was observed under two different conditions: We used a tube that contained air, and then the same tube, except with the air removed through a vacuum. In an idealized system without air resistance, all objects near Earth’s surface accelerate at the same rate due to gravity. However, in everyday conditions, the presence of air resistance acts against the acceleration due to gravity (\qty{9.8}{\meter\per\second\squared}) and reduces the net acceleration of lighter objects, particularly the feather \cite{tipler}. By observing the feather and penny in conditions with and without air, our experiment demonstrates the influence of air resistance on objects in free fall. It provides evidence of their effects on each object’s speed. We hypothesized that if objects fall in an environment with air resistance, then they will not experience constant acceleration, and may approach terminal velocity due to the opposing force of air resistance slowing down the net acceleration. However, if objects fall in an environment without air resistance, then they will accelerate uniformly due to gravity, resulting in similar accelerations due to gravity.





\section{Methods and materials}
We conducted this experiment using a meter stick, a few pieces of tape, a feather
weighing \qty{0.025}{\gram}, a penny weighing \qty{0.050}{\gram}, a transparent acrylic tube (inner diameter
\qty{8.00}{\centi\meter}), connected to a laboratory vacuum pump via a valve system to reduce air density inside
the tube. We had previously decided that we were going to film our experiment in order to
capture our data accordingly, which was done on an iPhone 14 at \qty{240}{frame\per\second}.
The camera was mounted stationary and perpendicular to the tube to minimize perspective
distortion. The high fps ensured that the objects in fall would be captured throughout, reducing
human reaction error and allowing us to collect more accurate position data. To minimize other
data collection errors from the video and because the tube had to be flipped, causing
unsteadiness, we taped our meter stick to the tube. This allowed us not to have to limit our range
of motion and could flip the tube easily, all while still being able to capture a measurement of
position for each of the objects in the video. To obtain the positions of each object in the
presence of air resistance, the tube was screwed tight, containing both the penny and the feather,
and an open valve that allowed air inside of it. Before we started to film, the tube had already
been flipped upside down, and we filmed and used the data of it being flipped right side up for a
total of five trials in order to average out the positions captured with the aim to minimize
confounding variables that one trial may have. To create the air-resistance-free environment, we
connected the vacuum to the tube with a pipe and waited for the air to be sucked out, which took
around ten minutes, and then we shut the valve. We had actually performed a test trial for this
and found that air was slowly seeping its way back into the tube, so we had to keep the tube
connected and the valve closed to ensure no air would come inside. A similar methodology was
used when actually collecting the data for the air-resistance free environment, where we also
collected data for a total of five trials. We then timestamped the videos and created tables
(separate) of the position of the penny and feather every \qty{0.25}{\second} for each trial of each
object, then averaged the results of all the trials. Finally, we created two graphs: one graph
representing the position vs time of a penny and a penny with air resistance present and one
graph representing the same with the same objects without air resistance present. To confirm our
hypothesis, average velocity was calculated using the finite difference equation:
\begin{equation}
V_{avg} = \left| \frac{\Delta y}{\Delta t} \right| 
\end{equation}
To associate each average velocity with a time value, a midpoint time was calculated by finding
the midpoint between two times, or by using the following equation:
\begin{equation}
t_{midpoint} = \dfrac{t_{next} - t_{current}}{2}
\end{equation}
The speeds and times were then put in a table to determine whether the velocity changed over
time, which would support or refute our hypothesis. A least squares regression line (LSRL) and
an $R^2$ value, the percentage of data accounted for by the LSRL, were also obtained. Although the
video was recorded at \qty{240}{frame\per\second}, position data were sampled at \qty{0.25}{\second} intervals to reduce
digitization noise; this choice significantly reduced the temporal resolution of the measurements.

\section{Discussion}
Average velocities were computed over fixed intervals; this does not imply constant
velocity or that terminal velocity was reached. Objects falling in air may reach a constant
velocity after sufficient time due to terminal velocity; the finite tube length likely limited the
extent to which full terminal velocity was reached in this experiment. Not only that, but they
exhibited similar accelerations, both hitting the ground at roughly the same time. \Cref{fig:1} displays
the position of the feather and the penny in relation to time, both color-coded. The feather
initially accelerated and then approached a regime where drag significantly reduced further
acceleration where drag forced a significant reduction in further acceleration, signalling that the
amount of air resistance was outweighing the feather itself. On the contrary, the penny had fallen
much quicker. The amount of air resistance that the object is affected by can be determined by
two things: the speed of the object and the cross-sectional area of the object, or the relative
magnitude of drag forces compared to gravitational force \cite{cioci-2022-galileo}. This is exemplified through
the feather, as it is tiny, weighs much less than a penny, and has soft, ridge-like corners that catch even more air, allowing for more air resistance. The penny, which is made of copper, making it
more dense and heavier, does not allow for much air resistance, allowing it to fall and hit the
ground almost immediately. The changing velocity is shown once again in \cref{tab:1}, where it is
suggested that the speeds of the feather and the penny are not the same or even similar. It is,
however, surprising how high the R-squared value of the feather in \cref{fig:1} is, especially since the
speeds are nowhere near being the same. Either way, a linear position-time relationship would
indicate constant velocity; however, accelerating motion is expected prior to reaching terminal
velocity, neither did the table of speeds show that it is constant in environments involving air
resistance.

In \cref{fig:2}, the plot of the feather and the penny is not only linear to the eye, but also very
close to each other in proximity, representing similar position-time behavior consistent with
constant acceleration and the same rate within each object. Supporting its linearity, the R-squared
values of both the feather and the penny are 0.963 and 0.982, respectively, showing great
accountability by the LSRL for all values in the data set. As seen in \cref{tab:2}, the speeds of both objects, after being calculated, are in fact similar, and it would be reasonable to conclude that both objects experienced similar accelerations due to gravity just as should happen in an
air-resistance-free environment.

Several possible sources of systemic error may have contributed to vouching for or
straying away from a constant speed in an air-resistance-free environment by around 5\%-10\%.
For example, the diameter of our tube was quite small, possibly conflicting with the actual
position of each object as they collided into the wall and each other. This is especially the case
for the feather and may account for its high R-squared value as given in \cref{fig:1}. As the feather hits
the sides of the tube, it may seem like it is falling more slowly when it really should not. If the
penny had interacted with the feather at all, it could have pushed it down with it, causing the rate
to be the same for both objects in the air-resistance-free environment when it may not have been.

Possible systematic errors include friction between the objects and the tube walls,
interaction between the feather and penny, and uncertainties introduced during the tube
inversion. These effects may influence the measured motion and limit generalization beyond this
setup.





\section{Acknowledgements} 
We thank several anonymous reviewers for providing helpful comments. SA produced the hypothesis, collected the data, and graphed it, allowing us to accurately depict the trends on the graph. AM was in charge of flipping the tube, ensuring that the feather and coin hit the side of the tube as little as possible to minimize outside factors that might interfere with the experiment and create a more accurate representation of no air resistance. SD was responsible for recording the experiment, ensuring the frame rate was accurate and that the data could be made intelligible from the video.
